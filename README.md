dh-debugedit
============

An experiment in adding source code to Debian debug packages.

This project contains debhelper and cdbs scripts for building
Debian debug packages using debugedit from the rpm package to
rewrite the location of source code to `/usr/src/` in much the
same way as the Fedora debuginfo packages.
